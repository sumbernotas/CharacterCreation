# CharacterCreation

This was a small school project that was done for one of my college courses. Our task was to create a simple text-based program that allows a user to create and set specific values to a character's stats. The idea behind this was to make a program that kept track of Dungeons & Dragons characters. Specifically, this project was to showcase our knowledge of pointers & references in C++. The program is still at its base requirements for what was needed in the class, so it is quite small and simple.
