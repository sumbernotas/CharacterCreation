# CharacterCreation

This is a side project that I have started to work on, it is currently incomplete. 
The goal of the finished program is to allow a user to create and store fantasy RPG characters, giving them access to all character stats, weapons, demographics, abilities, etc.
  this input will be able to be edited and changed to the users preference. 
So far, I have a base model program with no graphics that will allow the user to input character demographics and abilities. 
The character options will be based around DND style character paths and will be fully customizable. 
I still need to add many different options and settings. This program is far from complete and still in a base test mode for myself.
